# api-code-screen

This project is intended to test your ability to query an API, modify data, and post the data back to several endpoints we specify.

You may fork this project or copy the code. During the interview you will be expected to walkthrough the code and demonstrate the project.

You will pull down a block of JSON from this endpoint: https://k7o2mgxtv8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/public/manufacturers

You will modify the JSON as specified in the project comments and post it back to two other endpoints also provided in the project.

In order to complete this project you will need the [.NET SDK 6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)

You may use any IDE that will work with .NET, but we recommend either [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) (Community is more than sufficient for this task btw) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
